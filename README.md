## This project contains a program of the recipe system that ask the user to enter the information of the ingredients and the steps, allow the user  to scale the measurements and dispaly the recipe(s).

This project is built to  take in information of the recipe and display that information that will be inserted by the user.Every part of this  project is a sample code which shows the following :

* Ask the user if they want to enter the recipe
* Ask for the name of the recipe
* Ask the user to enter the information about the ingredients of the recipe
* Ask the user to enter the steps for the recipe
* Calculate the number of the calories
* Dispaly the menu for the user to choose the scale they want to display 

## The user instructions

## You find a bug?
If you found a bug while running this program or you would like to submit an improvement on the project please  submit the comment on rc learn so that i can solve the bug or improve on my  program on the next part of the project.

## Changes that i made  on this system from part 1
I made changes to  the system by using arrayList instead of arrays.I also used delegates which are like tools for making tasks easier.Now users are able to enter number of calories  of the ingredients.I also added a unit test to check if calorie calculations are correct.These changes makes the system to work smoother and reliablyWith ArrayLists and delegates,the system can handle different jobs  better.Overall this changes  makes the system easier to use and more dependable.
